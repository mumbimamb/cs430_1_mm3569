Overview
====================
A converter for PPM files in P3 or P6 format. It prints an error message if an error occurs, such as in user input or in the program itself.

Usage
====================
###In order to use the program and convert a P3 or P6 image to a P3 image, you must input:

"ppmrw 3 input.ppm output.ppm"

where "input.ppm" is the input file and "output.ppm" is the output file; "ppmrw" refers to the program and "3" establishes which format you would like the image to be converted to, P3.

#In order to convert a P3 or P6 to a P6 image, you must input:

"ppmrw 6 input.ppm output.ppm"

The terms have the same meaning as the p3 format conversion, however, this time "6" designates a conversion to the P6 format.


Purpose
